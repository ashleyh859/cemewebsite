# Team Contract

Working together as a team is critical for your success on this project. Conflicts are normal and to be expected. It's best to develop a plan for handling conflicts before they arise.

**This contract is a _living_ document.** If it's not working, your team should revise it as often as necessary.

## Contract

Your team contract should probably include these elements. Feel free to remove or add other terms, too.

1. To what goals do we all commit?

    we commit to effectively communicate and design a website suited to our client's audience's goals.

2. What are our "ground rules"? (Don't make an exhaustive listâ€”stick with just a few.)

    **Tip:** Interrupting another person can make them feel like their option isn't valued. Consider a rule about interrupting.

    - No judging we are all here to help each other learn.
    - Effective communication especially related to time and deadlines. Be honest about if you can complete tasks by deadlines.

3. By what means and how frequently will we meet or communicate?

    - We will meet at least once a week during our labs and we will effectively schedule meetings outside of class when needed.

4. How will we communicate and work with our client?

    -We will email and schedule zoom meetings/in person group meetings with our client.

5. What roles will we create? Include a description of exactly what each role is responsible for. (**No "coder" or "designer" roles are permitted;** everyone must design and code.)

    **Tip:** It's often helpful to think of **responsibilities** rather than roles here.

    -Outreacher: communicate with the client
    -Secretary: take meeting minutes during meetings,
    -Timekeeper: schedule meetings
    -Manager: hold everyone accountable of upcoming deadlines and tasks


6. How will we hold ourselves and one another accountable? What (exactly) will we say to a team member who appears not to be contributing equally? To a team member who fails to deliver what was promised?

    -If someone does not complete their delegated tasks, they will need to run up and down the slope three times. We will need to send weekly updates with our tasks. If a member is not appearing to be contributing, we will schedule three vs one meetings.

7. What do we do when we disagree? What approach to conflict to we all agree to uphold?

    -We will politely consider everyone's opinions and talking it out. If not, we vote.

8. What are our procedures for re-visiting this contract?

    - We will update this when needed as conflicts arise.

9. What else do we want to include in this contract? Maybe you team needs a _fun_ clause...

    **Tip:** Not everything in life is about work. Sometimes it is important to celebrate too. Consider grabbing a coffee or ice cream at the completion of your project to celebrate!

    - We will be a fun group.

    - We all have to have a boba schedule for the whole team and we can't pick flavors.


## Using your Contract

You are expected to follow your team contract. **If you are having issues (e.g. conflicts) in your team, the first thing you should do is follow the contract.** If the contract isn't working, then your team should revise it.

If you cannot resolve your conflict using the contract, please email the instructors at <info1300@cornell.edu>. Please be advised, that the first thing the instructor will ask you is, "did you try to resolve your issue with the contract?" The next question the instructor will ask you is, "what change did you make to your contract to resolve the issue?" You must attempt to resolve your conflicts on your own first before an instructor will intervene.
